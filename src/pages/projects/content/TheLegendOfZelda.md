*Unity (2024) · Team Project (2 people)*

---

## Overview
This project was done as a learning experience in **Unity game development**, where my partner and I rebuilt the **first dungeon from the original NES Legend of Zelda**.  

We focused on recreating the core gameplay mechanics such as **enemy behavior, dungeon layout, player controls**, and **combat mechanics**.  

---

## My Contributions
- Designed and programmed the **first custom boss** in the new level.  
- Built the **secret room** mechanic and integrated it into the dungeon.
- Re-created weapon mechanics such as the **bomb, and boomerang weapons**.  
- Developed the **door mechanics** and implemented **camera transitions** between rooms.  
- Assisted in overall dungeon layout and testing to ensure smooth progression and gameplay.

## Key Features
- **Dungeon recreation:** Classic rooms from Zelda’s first dungeon rebuilt in Unity.  
- **Custom mechanic:** Dodge roll added to the original moveset (only available in the custom level).  
- **New content:** Two new bosses designed and programmed for extended gameplay.  
- **Team collaboration:** Built with a partner, dividing roles across coding, design, and testing.

## Reflection
### This was one of my **first Unity projects**, and it taught me:  
- The fundamentals of Unity’s **component-based architecture** and MonoBehaviours.  
- How to collaborate on a Unity project without creating messy file transfers (mainly by avoiding working in the same scene simultaneously).  
- The value of extending an existing design with **original mechanics** like custom bosses and new rooms.  

### Looking back, there are also things I wish I had done differently:  
- I was too cautious at times, reluctant to experiment due to fear of breaking something. This limited how much I explored and learned.  
- I struggled with implementing behavior for one of the enemies and ended up with a very simple AI (wandering + contact damage, no pathfinding).  
- I didn’t apply object-oriented concepts like **polymorphism**, which I later realized would have made my code cleaner and more flexible.  
- If I could redo the project now, I’d take more risks, apply more advanced programming patterns, and focus on making the AI and mechanics more robust.
