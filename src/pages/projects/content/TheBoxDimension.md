## Overview
**The Box Dimension** is a real-time, turn-based strategy game where the player controls a cat that gains new abilities over time.  
The game was designed to be ~30 minutes long and was developed over the course of a semester.  

Beyond coding, our team worked on the **full development cycle**: story, marketing, trailer production, playtesting, and iteration based on student feedback.

## My Contributions
- Programmed the **respawn system**, giving players 3 lives to balance difficulty.  
- Designed and implemented **powerup items** (health regen, heal, area damage, attack range extension, and persistent AOE effects).  
- Built the **multiple different maps** directly in scripts, controlling how enemies, breakable boxes, walls, and powerups were spawned.  
- Participated in weekly **Jira task management**, playtests, and group planning meetings.

## Key Features
- **Progression-based gameplay**: Players start with limited abilities and gradually expand their toolkit.  
- **Powerup variety**: Multiple unique pickups (healing, attack buffs, AOEs).  
- **Replayable maps**: Configurable map scripting system for enemy spawns, obstacles, and rewards.  
- **Team production pipeline**: Included story, trailer, marketing, and multiple feedback-driven iterations.

## Reflection
### What I learned:  
- How to use **event-based programming** in a larger game.  
- The importance of **task management tools** (Jira) for coordinating a team of 5.  
- When a team starts moving together, **progress compounds quickly** compared to working alone.  
- The experience of following a project through its **entire lifecycle**: from concept to release.  

### What I wish we had done differently:  
- Our codebase became **messy (“spaghetti”)** as new features were rushed in. Better structure and rules could have prevented this.  
- Staying **organized as a group of 5** was difficult, especially without strict coding standards. 

### Biggest challenge:  
- **Team coordination and structure.** With more people, keeping consistency and order was harder than the actual coding.
